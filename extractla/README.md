The goal of the hackathon is to give NCG (2021) an opportunity to carry out a mini project and experience all the phases of a project, such as Design Documentation, Design Review, Project Development, Testing, User Documentation and Project Review.

## Problem Description

We use a lot of TLA (Three Letter Acronyms) in TI. The intention of the project is to identify TLA from a given document. The input document may be in PDF or an HTML format and may be specified through a URL. Your program should maintain an acronymn database where acronyms of 2 or more characters are stored. You may assume that all the characters of an acronym are in capital English alphabets. The program must maintain an acronym database. New acronyms located in the given document must be added to the database. If you find an acronym being used without a definition, your program should print an error. Any new acronyms found in the document must be incrementally added to the acryonym database.
